# exponent **
#priorites PEMDAS  parenthesis, exponent, multiplication, division, addition, substraction
# multiplication and division holds equal priority but the codes reas from left to right so among these two */ the left one will be executed first 
#for example
print(3*3 + 3/3 -3) #it should be 7, lets see
#so in the above ex. we saw that multiplication happend first
print(3/3 -4 *3) # this should be -11
# here the division took first because it is the most left 
# to round a 
print(round(2/3))


print(2/4)#this gives a float
print(2//4)#tis gives a int--floor division

result = 4
print(result)
result+=4
print(result)
result/=2
x= print(result)
print(type(x))
