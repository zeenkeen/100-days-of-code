#for loop in action
#list of fruits
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "mango"]
#now using for loop to print the list
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    print(fruit + "pie")
    print(fruits) #it print the list- the no. of time the loop runs which is 4 due to the no. of items in the list 

for item in fruits:
    print(fruits) 
    '''so above we see that for loop iterate through each item and prints whatever the print statement is.
    so it should have printed 4 times because the items in the list are four'''
